        <p>
          My typing speed averages between <strong>45â€“55 WPM</strong>,<br>
          and peaks at an impressive <strong>62 WPM over 15 seconds</strong>.<br>
          I maintain consistent speed and accuracy across sessions,<br>
          which helps me write, code, and document efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          This speed gives me an edge in real-time coding, documentation,<br>
          and handling large volumes of digital content without delay.<br>
          I practice regularly to enhance both speed and precision.
